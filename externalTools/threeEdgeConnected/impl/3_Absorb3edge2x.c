/*This program compute all 3edge connected components of a biconnected graph.
 You need to make an executable program file after compiling this program by
 using gcc compiler or another C compiler. A desired biconnected graph must
 be ready in a text file having the number of vertices at the first line
 and the adjacency lists of vertices in the following; each edge is determined
 by ">", and each list starts at a new	line. The name of the file has to be
 passed to the executable file as the first argument; e.g "./3edge graph.txt"
 Content example for an acceptable text file(i.e. graph.txt):
 5
 1>2>5>2
 2>5>4>4>3>3>1>1
 3>2>2
 4>2>2
 5>2>1
